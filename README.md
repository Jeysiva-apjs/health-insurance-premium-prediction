# Health Insurance Premium Prediction 

A **Machine Learning-powered web application** for predicting **health insurance premiums** based on user inputs like age, medical condition, smoking status, and other factors. The frontend is built using **Streamlit**, providing a simple and interactive user experience.

Live App:- https://jeysiva-apjs-health-insurance-premium-prediction.streamlit.app/

## Project Overview
This project utilizes a **regression-based Machine Learning model** to estimate health insurance costs. It features:

- **Frontend:** Developed with **Streamlit**, ensuring an intuitive and responsive UI.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Trained using **Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost** for accurate premium predictions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted detailed **EDA and data visualization** to understand feature relationships.
- **Data Processing:** Includes **data analysis, cleaning, and feature engineering** to enhance model performance.
- **Deployment:** Easily deployable on **Streamlit Cloud** for live access.  

##  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Frontend:** Streamlit  
- **ML Model:** Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Pandas, NumPy  
- **EDA & Visualization:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud   


## Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Visualization
Before training the model, extensive **EDA and data visualization** were performed to gain insights into the dataset, including:
- **Distribution of features** like age, income, and health condition.
- **Correlation analysis** to understand dependencies between variables.
- **Outlier detection and handling** to improve model robustness.
- **Null value detection and handling** to improve model accuracy.
- **Feature engineering** to enhance predictive power.
- **Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding** for categorical variables to improve model performance.
- Visualizations were created using **Matplotlib and Seaborn** to present key patterns and relationships in the data.
